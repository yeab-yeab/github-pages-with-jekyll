# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my self

My name is Yeabsera Dessalegn, but i kinda like it when someone calls me yeab.

currently in 2020 or 2013 of ethiopian calendar I am a second year computer science student.
You could ask why are you on github
Well to be honest i am here for theree reasons
  1 Beacuse I love to help others like by fixing there bugs
  2 Beacuse I always kinda loose my coding files on my computer so if I code on github that would make everything easy
  3 And of coursse as a programmer I do freelancing so when I go to someone to do something they wanna know what i have done before so it would be easy to show
